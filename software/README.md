# Mira Image Sensors: Software
### [main page](/README.md)



## Software and driver sources:
For Mira220, I've upstreamed a driver to the raspberr pi kernel github repo.
Libcamera changes reside in a fork
Other Mira sensor drivers are not yet public, but available on request.

* [Linux kernel with mira220 driver](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/tree/rpi-6.12.y) 
* [Libcamera with mira220 support](https://github.com/ams-OSRAM/libcamera)
